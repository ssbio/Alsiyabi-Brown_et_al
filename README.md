The folder labeled 'iRpa940_GAMS_simulations' contains simulated growth on the carbon sources acetate, butyrate and p-coumarate discussed in the paper.
The simulations were performed using GAMS and therefore require a licensed copy of the software. To perform simulations on any carbon source, run the corresponding .gms
code.
